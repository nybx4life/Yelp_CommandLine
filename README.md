# Yelp Command Line

This is a simple Ruby application using Yelp API to take some commands and bring out some results.

Here's some examples:
- search burritos in New York
- best burgers in Brooklyn
- closest tacos in 16 William St, New York, 10038



This was made in DBC as part of a group project.
